##  Contest Resources

### **Problem Statement**
Our team has selected:  
 **Problem C: Models for Olympic Medal Tables**  

 **[2025_MCM_Problem_C.pdf](./2025_MCM_Problem_C.pdf)** (Full problem description)

## Overview

This repository contains our work for the Mathematical Contest in Modeling  (MCM) 2025. The project focuses on analyzing and modeling  Olympic-related datasets to address the assigned problem.

## Datasets

### 1. **Athletes Data** (`summerOly_athletes.csv`)

Contains information about athletes, including:

- Name
- Sex
- Country (NOC)
- Year of participation
- City of participation
- Sport and Event
- Medal information

### 2. **Hosts Data** (`summerOly_hosts.csv`)

Contains details of Olympic host cities, including:

- Year of the games
- Host country and city

### 3. **Medal Counts Data** (`summerOly_medal_counts.csv`)

Contains data on the number of medals won by each country:

- Country (NOC)
- Gold, Silver, and Bronze medal counts

### 4. **Programs Data** (`summerOly_programs.csv`)

Contains details of Olympic events and programs:

- Year of the games
- Sport and Event details

 **Google Colab Notebook for modeling and analysis**  
 [Shared Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l5XClt-Y3wC6nGcHPvl2qC5Na8WL51aJ?usp=drive_link)  

### **Modeling Approach**
 **Main Goals:**
1. **Develop a model to predict medal counts** (Gold and total medals)  
2. **Forecast the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics** medal table with confidence intervals  
3. **Predict new countries winning their first Olympic medal**  
4. **Analyze the relationship between sports events and national medal counts**  
5. **Evaluate the impact of "Great Coach" Effect** on medal gains  

 **Code Implementation:**  
- **`20250127_1750.ipynb`** (Google Colab notebook for modeling)
